# Sequence-Alignment-Web-Interface

This project encompasses a web platform designed to compare and align two distinct biological sequences. Sequence alignment is achieved by leveraging the Python language and utilizing the BioPython library.

Features:

Comparison of Two Sequences: Users have the option to input two sequences for comparison in the appropriate fields.

Sequence Alignment: The interface uses the alignment algorithm to identify the best match between the sequences.

Alignment Results: The alignment conclusions are presented to the user, highlighting similarities and differences between the sequences.

Technologies Used:

Python: Used as the main programming language to implement the underlying logic of the web interface and the alignment algorithm.

BioPython: A specialized Python library for processing biological sequences, with a focus on sequence alignment.

Web Framework: Flask
